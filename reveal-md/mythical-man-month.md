## Some final comments from Brooks...

----

### The best process for design?

> "Great design does not come from great processes; it comes from great
> designers" ~Brooks

----

### Surely better processes help designers to be great?

> "The critical thing about the design process is to identify your scarcest
> resource. Despite what you may think, that very often is not money. For
> example, in a NASA moon shot, money is abundant but lightness is scarce;
> every ounce of weight requires tons of material below. On the design of a
> beach vacation home, the limitation may be your ocean-front footage. You have
> to make sure your whole team understands what scarce resource youâ€™re
> optimizing." ~Brooks
